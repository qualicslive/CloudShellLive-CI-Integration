# CloudShellLive-CI-Integration
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/qualicslive/CloudShellLive-CI-Integration.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/qualicslive/CloudShellLive-CI-Integration)

This repo is used to demonstrate how external build and testing solutions can integrate with CloudShell.

Here, Travis (press link above) as well as Jenkins will trigger automatic builds based on a commit to this GitHub repo. The simple tests will then run against the modified code base to ensure that the code change did not break anything.
